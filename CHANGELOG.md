# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Checkpoints now persist across session resumes - entry IDs are embedded in git ref names and rebuilt on session start
- **Critical**: Fixed checkpoint being associated with wrong entry ID (was using previous assistant entry instead of current user entry)
- **Critical**: Pruning no longer incorrectly removes Map entries for newer checkpoints when deleting older ones for same entry
- Tree navigation now always shows options menu (even when no checkpoint available)
- Branch now offers "Conversation only" option even when no checkpoint is available

### Changed
- Checkpoint ref format now includes entry ID: `checkpoint-{timestamp}-{entryId}`
- Added `rebuildCheckpointsMap()` to reconstruct entry→checkpoint mappings from git refs
- Use leaf entry at `turn_start` (the user message) instead of tracking via `tool_result`
- Added `--sort=creatordate` to `for-each-ref` calls for consistent ordering
- Removed unused `tool_result` handler

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-05

### Breaking Changes
- Requires pi v0.35.0+ (unified extensions system)
- Install location changed from `hooks/rewind` to `extensions/rewind`

### Changed
- Migrated from hooks to unified extensions system
- Settings key changed from `hooks` to `extensions`
- Install script now migrates old hooks config and cleans up old directory
- Renamed "Hook" to "Extension" throughout codebase and docs

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-03

### Added
- Tree navigation support (`session_before_tree`) - restore files when navigating session tree
- Entry-based checkpoint mapping (uses entry IDs instead of turn indices)

### Changed
- Migrated to granular session events API (pi-coding-agent v0.31+)
- Use `pi.exec` instead of `ctx.exec` per updated hooks API

### Fixed
- Removed `agent_end` handler that was clearing checkpoints after each turn
- "Undo last file rewind" now cancels branch instead of creating unwanted branch

## [1.1.1] - 2024-12-27

### Fixed
- Use `before_branch` event instead of `branch` for proper hook timing (thanks @badlogic)
- Cancel branch when user dismisses restore options menu

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-27

### Added
- "Undo last file rewind" option - restore files to state before last rewind
- Checkpoints now capture uncommitted and untracked files (not just HEAD)
- Git repo detection - hook gracefully skips in non-git directories

### Changed
- Checkpoints use `git write-tree` with temp index to capture working directory state
- Pruning excludes before-restore ref and current session's resume checkpoint

### Fixed
- Code-only restore options now properly skip conversation restore

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- Initial release
- Automatic checkpoints at session start and each turn
- `/branch` integration with restore options:
  - Restore all (files + conversation)
  - Conversation only (keep current files)
  - Code only (restore files, keep conversation)
- Resume checkpoint for pre-session messages
- Automatic pruning (keeps last 100 checkpoints)
- Cross-platform installation via `npx pi-rewind-hook`
